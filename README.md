# 🧩 Realistic 3D Rubik’s Cube (Three.js + GSAP)

A **fully interactive 3D Rubik’s Cube** built using **Three.js**, **GSAP**, and vanilla **HTML/CSS**.  
Rotate the entire cube freely with your mouse, and **click + drag** any cube face to twist it —  
just like a real-world Rubik’s Cube!

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Realistic 3D Cube**  
- Built using `Three.js` 3D graphics library.  
- Smooth, polished surfaces with realistic reflections and lighting.  

✅ **Mouse Controls**  
- Move your mouse to **rotate the cube** freely in 3D space.  
- Click and drag on any cube face to **rotate that layer**.  

✅ **Authentic Look**  
- 6 colored sides: Green, Blue, Red, Orange, White, Yellow.  
- Matte black cube base with glossy color tiles.  
- Dynamic lighting, soft shadows, and clean background.  

✅ **Interactive Mechanics**  
- Face detection and rotation groups using raycasting.  
- GSAP-powered animations for smooth face rotations.  

✅ **Optimized Performance**  
- Lightweight scene setup.  
- Runs smoothly in browsers supporting WebGL.
